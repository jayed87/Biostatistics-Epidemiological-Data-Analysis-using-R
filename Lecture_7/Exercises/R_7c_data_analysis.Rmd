## Preparations

Load KiGGS data:

```{r}
dat_link <- url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/pd0z829pv2otzqt/KiGGS03_06.RData?dl=1")
load(dat_link)
kiggs <- KiGGS03_06
```

## Task

- Get together in groups of 4 people.
- Choose study question: without looking at the KIGGS dataset, choose 2 health related research questions, that investigate the association between 2 variables.
- Have a look at the KIGGS data dictionnary to see which variables are available. Choose one of the two research questions, and investigate this in the KIGGS dataset. 
- You might have to use proxy variables, you will have to check+transform variables ...
- Look at variables, compute descriptive statistics, maybe plots, estimate+test association + interprete.
- Every group that is able to answer the research question will get one free pass at homework. :-)

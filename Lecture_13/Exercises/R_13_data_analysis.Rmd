## Load KiGGS data

```{r}
dat_link <- url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/pd0z829pv2otzqt/KiGGS03_06.RData?dl=1")
load(dat_link)
dat <- KiGGS03_06
```

## Analysis

Let's look at the variable e025a, which describes whether the child has reading help.

```{r}
# format
dat$e025a <- factor(dat$e025a, labels = c("yes", "no"))

# first look at the variable
table(dat$e025a)
```

Get together in groups, and investigate variables that are associated with needing a reading help. 

Choose 3-5 variables that you think are relevant.

Think of a suitable statistical model how to investigate this (you could also include the age when the child got their reading help into the analysis: e025z1)?

Format the variables.

Do the analysis.

Check the assumptions of the analysis.

Interpret the results.
